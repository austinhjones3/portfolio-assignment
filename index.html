        <div class="aboutBody">
          <p>
            When I was a teenager, I had many ideas for blogs, websites, and web
            marketing. I would spend a decent amount of my free time trying to piece
            together these ideas without any technical knowledge. It is only natural
            that I grew up to learn how to make these ideas a reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best part of software engineering, to me, is collaborating with other
            people to solve problems. I enjoy banding together with people with
            common goals to create efficient, well-structured solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy: working out, reading non-fiction, watching
            dramas, animes, and Star Wars, listening to music, hanging out with my
            fiancé and daughter, and working on side projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am confident in: Node.js, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and unit
            testing. As such, I can build a website for you. I am also able to fix
            problems that your website may be having. In addition to these two
            services, I offer consultation before any service charge is rendered.

              I decided the best way to review my knowledge of making AJAX requests
              with async-await in Node.js would be to make a small application that
              calls an API I’ve never used before. I chose Coinbase’s
              non-authenticated public API options. The users have four options for
              requests. When a request is selected, it is fulfilled with Axios. Then
              the user has the choice to make another request or to end the run. The
              front end for this project is the old reliable terminal.

              A few other engineering students and I at Thinkful worked together to
              create our solutions for the Caesar cipher, the substitution cipher,
              and the Polybius square cipher in Node.js. We also built mocha and chai
              tests for our solutions. It was fun to work through these ciphers using
              more primitive programming practices. It helped me to nail down some of
              the basics. Reviewing the basics is important because I am also
              learning more and more modern syntax.

          <article class="item projectBody">
            <h4 class="projectName">
              <a
                href="https://github.com/austinhjones3/project-local-library"
                target="_blank"
                >Local Library</a
              >
            </h4>
            <p>
              The local library is a back-end Node.js data handling and structuring
              program that uses many array methods and a ton of ES6 syntax. Sets of
              data such as authors, books, and library account members interact with
              each other. The goal was to organize the data into different filter
              sets that show the data in a more palatable interface. Scrolling
              through lines and lines of data does not make for the best user
              experience. Here, I learned a lot about arrays and objects.
